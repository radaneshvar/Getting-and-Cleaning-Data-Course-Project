# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the project of Data Science Course - Course 3: Getting and Cleaning Data.

I created a 'run_analysis.R' script that is clear and understandable. It has sufficient notes and labels to explain how it work within it.

Description of steps and variables have been provided in the CodeBook file.

Thanks.
